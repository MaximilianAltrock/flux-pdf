### Dragging multiple files onto the PageGrid: Every Source has the same color

### add source to sourcerail should be a action, because currently it messes up the history eg. If you have a new session with just Session Start and you add a source to source rail it the session start state has the source with 0 pages. If you then add another file directly to the grid the state becomes Add "xxx.pdf" going back to Session Start the added pdf is removed like it should be the other Source from SourceRail is still present (with 0 pages). This will confuse users because Session Start is probably expected to be empty (No pages no Sources).

### BookmarkTree DnD Placeholders are currently implemented badly they´re shown everywhere when dragging a item
